[X] Set up version control
[X] Figure out data storage method
[~] Re-learn everything you forgot (so, everything)
[~] Part 1: Importing and data storage
    [~] Write
        [X] Ecoplate_analysis.py
        [~] Plate.py (class)
            [ ] Create carbon source array
            [X] Everything else
    [ ] Debug
    [ ] Integrate into main program
[~] Part 2: Data analysis
    [~] Figure out what I am actually supposed to do (what is AWCD used for?)
    [ ] Write
    [ ] Debug
    [ ] Integrate into main program
[ ] Part 3: Exporting data
    [ ] Learn how to write to CSV files
    [ ] Have an existential crisis because all logic in the world is gone
    [ ] Write
    [ ] Debug
    [ ] Cry one more time
    [ ] Integrate into main program


Current plan is to leave all debugging until Part 2 is done, so I can actually use the data to see if it stored correctly.
